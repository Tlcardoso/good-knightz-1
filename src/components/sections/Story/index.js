        In the beginning, there was darkness across the Cryptoverse. Scammers, rug pulls, and 50% attacks ran rampant sowing chaos and despair. But from the darkness bloomed a bright spot, full of color and passion. The NFT space was born. NFT creators fought back using kitties, punks, and apes but this wasn’t enough.<br /><br />
        The Cryptoverse responded with even more FUD, the right-click savorrrrrs were winning. Then a miracle happened! The NFT space banded together to fight back, crying out in one loud voice “gm”. gm became the heart of the community, uniting people from around the world as the sign of hope and dawn of a new day.<br /><br />
        
        WE are these brave souls, the protectors of the good morning realm, the shield against the darkness. WE are The Good Knightz, defenders of the good morning. Do you have what it takes to be the shield?<br /><br />
